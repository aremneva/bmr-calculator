        "About Marathon Skills 2016
        Marathon Skills is a running festival held every year in different parts of the world. There can be three events: a Full Marathon, a Half Marathon and a race for beginners - so the festival is suitable for everyone.
In past years, the marathon has been held in Osaka, Japan (2014); Leipzig, Germany (2013); Hanoi, Vietnam (2012) and York, England (2011).
